Plantifi is app to manage your home plants. The app contains a small database of popular houseplants. Moreover, it can recognize plants by returning name, description plant.

Plantifi was created with the involvement of the UX team and my work as a frontend developer. Klaudia Ginter, acting as the Lead UX, showed me all the assumptions of the application. Many of them have been successfully incorporated into the project.

A large part of team believes that with the investor's support we will be able to implement such functionalities as:
-user authentication;
-swipe navigation;
-plant health;
